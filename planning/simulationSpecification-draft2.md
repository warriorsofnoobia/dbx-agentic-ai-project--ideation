# 0. Overview

The goal:
***Implement an agentic AI solution for a warehouse reorder use-case.***

---

Essentially, the use-case is as follows:

- Warehouse stocks items of types A, B, C... etc.
- Suppliers exist for each item type
- Consumers exist for each item type

***First, we need to simulate the use-case.***

To keep it simple, we have the following assumptions:

- The set of suppliers and consumers are fixed
- One supplier per item type
- One consumer per item type

But, naturally, consumer demand patterns and supplier supply patterns can vary.

However, to ensure the simulation setup is extensible:

- I want to be able to vary supply and demand patterns as per:
   - Statistical distributions
   - Custom patterns
- I want to be able to make 1 supplier the source of 1 or more item types
- I want to be able to make 1 consumer the demander for 1 or more item types

# 1. Constraints

## Fixed-World Constraints

- The set of item types is fixed for the duration of a simulation run
- The set of suppliers is fixed <br> => *No supplier can enter or exit during a run*
- The set of consumers is fixed <br> => *No consumer can enter or exit during a run*
- Each item type has exactly:
    - 1 designated supplier
    - 1 designated consumer
- Supplier failures are excluded as a disruption type <br> => *All suppliers remain operational throughout the run*

## Structural Constraints

- The warehouse is a single-echelon node<br> => *No distribution centre hierarchy*
- Stock levels cannot go below zero <br> => *Unmet demand is recorded as a stockout, not a backorder (**no negative inventory**)*
- A reorder can be placed:
    - Only if warehouse has enough budget remaining
    - Unless the budget constraint is disabled.
- Reorder quantities must be non-negative integers <br> => *Partial units are not supported*
- Lead time:
    - Is expressed in simulation ticks (e.g. days)
    - Must be a positive integer of at least 1
    - Must be decided per item per supplier per tick

> **NOTE**: *Lead time is the total latency between the initiation and completion of a process, such as the time from placing an order to receiving it, or from starting a project to finishing it.*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (critical)** - *Lead time floor must be engine-enforced, not just declared. The formula `round(Normal(base_lead_time_ticks, lead_time_variability))` can produce 0 or negative values when variability is large relative to the base. The engine must clamp the sampled value to ≥ 1 **before** applying any disruption multiplier. This should be stated explicitly as a mechanical rule here, not left as an implication of the constraint above.*

## Temporal Constraints

- The simulation has a number of modes:
    - Running for a defined number of discrete ticks
    - Running forever non-cyclically
    - Running forever cyclically
- All events are resolved in a fixed sequence within each tick:
    - (1) Pending supply arrives
    - (2) Demand is drawn
    - (3) Stock is updated
    - (4) The agent evaluates and optionally places reorders
- Disruption events are either of the following:
    - Pre-scheduled
    - Stochastically injected before the tick resolves

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (critical)** - *Tick sequence step (3) is ambiguous. "Stock is updated" does not state whether it reflects arrival only (after step 1), demand depletion only (after step 2), or both. The agent in step (4) reads `stock_on_hand` from `ops_warehouse_state` - it must be clear what that value represents. Suggested clarification:*
> - *(3a) Stock is increased by arrived supply (result of step 1)*
> - *(3b) Stock is decreased by fulfilled demand (result of step 2), floored at zero; unmet demand is recorded*
> - *The `stock_on_hand` the agent sees in step (4) reflects both adjustments.*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (critical)** - *The injection point of stochastic disruptions is underspecified. "Before the tick resolves" is ambiguous - does injection happen before step (1), between steps (1) and (2), or at a fixed sub-step 0? This matters because a `transit_delay` disruption that is injected after step (1) would not affect orders arriving that tick, while one injected before step (1) would. Suggested rule: stochastic disruption activation is evaluated as sub-step (0), before any other tick events, in `disruption_id` order for determinism.*

# 2. Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-01**: The simulation must:
    - Advance through discrete time ticks
    - Persist state at each tick

- **FR-02**: Demand must be drawn:
    - Per item type per tick
    - From a configurable pattern; either one of:
        - Statistical distribution
        - Custom schedule

- **FR-03**: Supply per reorder must arrive:
    - After the configured lead time
    - For that item type, supplier and tick

- **FR-04**: The agent must receive a complete view of: <br> **NOTE**: *This must be received before making a reorder decision*
    - Current stock
    - Pending orders (with expected arrival ticks)
    - Recent demand history
    - Active disruptions

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *FR-04 does not define how much demand history the agent receives. "Recent" is ambiguous and will lead to inconsistent implementations. Suggest adding: the agent receives the last N ticks of `hist_demand_actuals`, where N is a simulation-level config parameter (e.g. `agent_history_window_ticks`), defaulting to all available history if null.*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *FR-04 and FR-05 together do not specify whether the agent receives the full cost accumulator or only `remaining_budget`. Suggest clarifying: the agent receives a read-only snapshot of `ops_cost_accumulator` for all its managed item types, in addition to the `remaining_budget` figure.*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *FR-04 does not clarify the role of `reorder_point`. Is agent evaluation suppressed when `stock_on_hand > reorder_point`, or does the agent always evaluate and the reorder point is advisory context? This distinction is critical for agent design. Suggest stating explicitly: evaluation is triggered on every tick, but `reorder_point` is surfaced as a reference signal in the agent's context. The agent may choose to act even when above the reorder point.*

- **FR-05**: The cost model must:
    - Accumulate (each tick):
        - Holding costs
        - Stockout costs
        - Order costs
    - Expose a running total to:
        - The agent
        - The observability layer

- **FR-06**: Disruption events:
    - Must be injectable as either:
        - Pre-defined schedules
        - Stochastically generated
    - Must affect:
        - Demand magnitude
        - Lead time
        - Transit loss

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *FR-06 does not define the resolution rule when multiple disruptions of the same type are simultaneously active on the same item (e.g. two concurrent `demand_spike` records). Suggest adding: when multiple disruptions of the same type are active on the same item in the same tick, their magnitudes are **multiplied** together (not summed). If a different rule is intended, it must be stated here.*

- **FR-07**: The simulation must be fully reproducible given:
    - The same random seed
    - The same world configuration

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (critical)** - *FR-07 reproducibility requires that all random draws within a tick happen in a fixed, implementation-independent order. Without this, two correct implementations using the same seed may diverge. Suggest adding: within each tick, random draws are made in the following order: (1) stochastic disruption activation (in `disruption_id` alphabetical order), (2) demand sampling (in `item_id` alphabetical order), (3) lead time sampling for any reorders placed (in order of placement). All draws use a single shared RNG initialised from `random_seed`.*

- **FR-08**: All state transitions must be written to an event log.

**NOTE**: *This event log must be append-only.*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *FR-08 states "all state transitions" must be logged, but the event type table in section 7 does not include `TICK_STARTED` or `TICK_ENDED` events. Without these, it is impossible to distinguish "nothing happened this tick" from a logging gap, and replaying a run is ambiguous for quiet ticks. Suggest adding `TICK_STARTED` and `TICK_ENDED` event types, each carrying the tick number as a payload field.*

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-01**: The configuration schema must allow:
    - Any item type to be mapped to:
        - Any supplier
        - Any consumer entity
    - Without code changes

- **NFR-02**: Pattern definitions (distributions and custom schedules) must be:
    - Swappable per item type
    - Without altering the engine

- **NFR-03**: The simulation clock tick size (e.g. daily, hourly) must be:
    - A configuration parameter
    - Not a hardcoded assumption

- **NFR-04**: The cost model parameters must be:
    - Independently configurable
    - Per item type

- **NFR-05**: The system must support:
    - At least 2 disruption types
    - Simultaneous activation of these on the same item type

# 3. Parameters

## 3.1 Simulation-Level Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sim_id` | string | Unique identifier for the simulation run |
| `random_seed` | integer | Seed for all stochastic processes; ensures reproducibility |
| `num_ticks` | integer | Total number of ticks to simulate; null = infinite |
| `tick_unit` | enum | Granularity of one tick: `hour`, `day`, `week` |
| `budget_limit` | float | Total spend cap across all reorders for the run; null = unlimited |
| `start_timestamp` | datetime | Wall-clock anchor for tick 0 |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *Add `agent_history_window_ticks` (integer, null = unlimited) as a simulation-level parameter controlling how many ticks of demand history are exposed to the agent (see FR-04 note above).*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (minor)** - *Add `budget_warning_threshold` (float, default 0.10) as a simulation-level parameter. The 10% budget warning threshold is currently hardcoded in the `BUDGET_WARNING` event definition. Making it configurable avoids a hidden magic number.*

## 3.2 Item-Type Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Relates to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `item_id` | string | Unique item type identifier | All layers |
| `initial_stock` | integer | Stock on hand at tick 0 | Warehouse state |
| `reorder_point` | integer | Stock level that triggers agent evaluation | Agent decision |
| `min_order_qty` | integer | Minimum units per reorder (MOQ) | Lead time, cost model |
| `max_order_qty` | integer | Maximum units per single reorder | Agent constraint |
| `unit_value` | float | Value of one unit, used to compute holding cost | Cost model |

## 3.3 Supplier Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Relates to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `supplier_id` | string | Unique supplier identifier | Mapping tables |
| `item_ids_supplied` | list[string] | Item types this supplier covers | Supplier-item mapping |
| `base_lead_time_ticks` | integer | Normal ticks between reorder placement and arrival | Lead time |
| `lead_time_variability` | float | Std dev of lead time in ticks (0 = deterministic) | Lead time, disruptions |

## 3.4 Consumer Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Relates to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `consumer_id` | string | Unique consumer identifier | Mapping tables |
| `item_ids_demanded` | list[string] | Item types this consumer demands | Consumer-item mapping |

## 3.5 Demand and Supply Pattern Parameters

Each pattern entry applies to one `(item_id, role)` pair, where role is `demand` or `supply`.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern_type` | enum | `statistical` or `custom` |
| `distribution` | enum | `poisson`, `normal`, `uniform`, `negative_binomial`, `zero_inflated_poisson`; null if custom |
| `dist_params` | json | Distribution-specific parameters (e.g. `{"mu": 50}` for Poisson) |
| `custom_schedule` | list[float] | Ordered list of values, one per tick; cycled if shorter than `num_ticks`; null if statistical |
| `seasonal_multiplier_schedule` | list[float] | Optional per-tick multiplier applied on top of the base pattern (e.g. for weekly seasonality) |
| `noise_std` | float | Optional Gaussian noise added after pattern evaluation |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (critical)** - *The `supply` role in `env_patterns` is referenced in the schema but never defined mechanically. What does a `supply` pattern control? Candidate interpretations include: a per-tick cap on order quantity a supplier will fulfil, a rate-of-supply multiplier, or a maximum units available from the supplier per tick. Without this definition, the role cannot be implemented. Either define the mechanism fully here, or remove `supply` as a valid role until it is specified.*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (minor)** - *The rounding rule for converting a float pattern sample to an integer demand quantity is not specified. Suggest stating: the sampled float value (after multipliers and noise) is converted to an integer by `floor()`, with a minimum of 0.*

## 3.6 Lead Time Parameters

> **NOTE**: *Lead time is the delay (in ticks) between when a reorder is placed and when the goods arrive at the warehouse.*

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `base_lead_time_ticks` | integer | Set on supplier; see [3.3 Supplier Parameters](#33-supplier-parameters) |
| `lead_time_variability` | float | Set on supplier; see [3.3 Supplier Parameters](#33-supplier-parameters) |
| `disruption_lead_time_multiplier` | float | Applied during active transit delay disruption (e.g. 2.0 = double lead time) |

At reorder placement, the engine:
- Samples an actual lead time as: <br> `actual_lead_time = round(Normal(base_lead_time_ticks, lead_time_variability))`
- Then applies any active disruption multiplier <br> **NOTE**: *This multiplier is clamped to a minimum of 1*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (critical)** - *The sampled `actual_lead_time` must be clamped to ≥ 1 before the disruption multiplier is applied. With high `lead_time_variability`, `round(Normal(...))` can produce 0 or negative values. Suggest the full expression be stated as: `actual_lead_time = max(1, round(Normal(base_lead_time_ticks, lead_time_variability)))`, then `effective_lead_time = actual_lead_time × max(1.0, disruption_multiplier)`.*

## 3.7 Cost Model Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Per Item? | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `holding_cost_per_unit_per_tick` | float | Yes | Cost of holding one unit in stock for one tick |
| `stockout_cost_per_unit_per_tick` | float | Yes | Penalty cost per unit of unmet demand per tick |
| `order_fixed_cost` | float | Yes | Fixed cost incurred each time a reorder is placed, regardless of quantity |
| `order_variable_cost_per_unit` | float | Yes | Variable cost per unit ordered (price paid to supplier) |
| `transit_loss_cost_per_unit` | float | Yes | Cost per unit lost in transit during a transit loss disruption |

**Cost accumulation per tick:**
- Holding cost = `current_stock × holding_cost_per_unit_per_tick`
- Stockout cost = `unmet_demand × stockout_cost_per_unit_per_tick`
- Order cost (at placement) = `order_fixed_cost + (order_qty × order_variable_cost_per_unit)`
- Transit loss cost (at arrival) = `units_lost × transit_loss_cost_per_unit`

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (minor)** - *The holding cost formula uses `current_stock` but does not specify the point in the tick at which stock is measured. Suggest stating: holding cost is computed on `stock_on_hand` as it stands at the end of the tick, after both supply arrivals and demand depletion have been applied (i.e. the same value the agent sees).*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (minor)** - *Tick 0 holding cost is unspecified. Suggest stating: holding cost accrues from tick 0 on `initial_stock`, so that the first holding cost entry in `hist_cost_by_tick` is at tick 0.*

## 3.8 Disruption Parameters

Each disruption record applies to:
- A specific item type
- Over a specific tick range

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `disruption_id` | string | Unique identifier |
| `item_id` | string | Affected item type |
| `disruption_type` | enum | `demand_spike`, `demand_suppression`, `transit_delay`, `transit_loss` |
| `start_tick` | integer | First tick of the disruption |
| `end_tick` | integer | Last tick of the disruption (inclusive) |
| `magnitude` | float | Type-specific: multiplier for demand disruptions; multiplier for lead time in transit delay; fraction of in-transit units lost for transit loss |
| `is_stochastic` | boolean | If true, the disruption is injected probabilistically each tick using `trigger_probability` |
| `trigger_probability` | float | Per-tick probability of a stochastic disruption activating (null if not stochastic) |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *`magnitude` has no defined valid range. For demand multipliers and lead time multipliers, a value of 0 or below is nonsensical and a value above some ceiling may indicate a misconfiguration. For transit loss, `magnitude` is a fraction and must be in [0.0, 1.0]. Suggest adding validation rules: `magnitude > 0` for `demand_spike`, `demand_suppression`, and `transit_delay`; `0.0 ≤ magnitude ≤ 1.0` for `transit_loss`.*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *The stochastic activation model checks `trigger_probability` per tick within `[start_tick, end_tick]`, but this is not explicitly stated. Suggest adding: for stochastic disruptions, the engine evaluates activation once per tick for each tick within the window; if the draw exceeds `trigger_probability`, the disruption is inactive for that tick and `is_active_this_tick` is set to false. The disruption record still appears in `ops_active_disruptions` for the full window.*

**Disruption type effects**:

`demand_spike`:
Multiplies drawn demand by `magnitude` (e.g. 3.0 = triple demand).

`demand_suppression`:
Multiplies drawn demand by `magnitude` (e.g. 0.2 = 80% reduction).

`transit_delay`:
Multiplies computed lead time by `magnitude`:
  - For any reorder placed during the disruption window

`transit_loss`:
On arrival:
- A fraction `magnitude` of the incoming order quantity is lost
- Only the remainder enters stock

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *No status exists for an order that is fully destroyed by transit loss (`magnitude = 1.0`). The current `ops_pending_orders.status` enum has `partially_lost` but no `fully_lost`. Suggest adding `fully_lost` as a valid status, or capping `magnitude` for `transit_loss` below 1.0 and documenting that cap.*

# 4. Environment Data Tables

- These tables define the static world configuration
- They are written once before the simulation runs
- They do not change during a run

| `transit_loss_cost_per_unit` | float | Cost per unit lost in transit |

## `env_suppliers`

Defines all supplier entities.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `supplier_id` | string PK | Unique supplier identifier |
| `supplier_name` | string | Human-readable label |
| `base_lead_time_ticks` | integer | Baseline lead time for orders placed with this supplier |

## `env_supplier_item_map`

Many-to-many mapping between suppliers and item types.

**NOTE**: *Constrained to 1 supplier per item type per simulation run (this is conceptual, not enforced).*

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run identifier |
| `supplier_id` | string FK | Supplier |
| `item_id` | string FK | Item type served by this supplier |

## `env_consumers`

Defines all consumer entities.

|---|---|---|
| `consumer_id` | string PK | Unique consumer identifier |
| `consumer_name` | string | Human-readable label |

## `env_consumer_item_map`

Many-to-many mapping between consumers and item types.

## `env_patterns`

Demand and supply pattern configurations.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern_id` | string PK | Unique pattern identifier |
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run |
| `item_id` | string FK | Item type this pattern applies to |
| `role` | enum | `demand` or `supply` |
| `pattern_type` | enum | `statistical` or `custom` |
| `distribution` | string | Distribution name; null if custom |
| `dist_params` | json | Distribution parameters; null if custom |
| `custom_schedule` | array[float] | Per-tick values; null if statistical |
| `seasonal_multiplier_schedule` | array[float] | Optional seasonal overlay |
| `noise_std` | float | Optional Gaussian noise; 0 if none |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (critical)** - *The `supply` role is present in the schema but the engine behaviour it drives is never defined in the spec (see also section 3.5 note). Additionally, this table has no FK to `env_suppliers`, so a `supply`-role pattern cannot be attributed to a specific supplier. Suggest either: (a) removing `supply` from the `role` enum until the mechanism is fully defined, or (b) adding a `supplier_id` FK column (nullable) that is required when `role = supply`.*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (minor)** - *There is no unique constraint preventing two patterns with the same `(sim_id, item_id, role)`. Suggest adding `UNIQUE (sim_id, item_id, role)` to prevent ambiguous double-registration of a pattern for the same item and role.*

## `env_disruption_schedule`

Pre-defined disruption events for a simulation run.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|

| `budget_limit` | float | Total budget cap; null = unlimited |
| `start_timestamp` | datetime | Wall-clock anchor for tick 0 |
| `created_at` | datetime | When this config was registered |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *Add `agent_history_window_ticks` (integer, null = unlimited) and `budget_warning_threshold` (float, default 0.10) to this table to match the parameter additions suggested in section 3.1.*

# 5. Operational Data Tables

These tables hold live state during the simulation run. They are read and written by the simulation engine each tick.

## `ops_warehouse_state`

Current stock level per item type, updated at the end of each tick.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run |
| `tick` | integer | Current tick |
| `item_id` | string FK | Item type |
| `stock_on_hand` | integer | Units currently in warehouse |
| `stock_in_transit` | integer | Units on order, not yet arrived |
| `expected_arrivals_next_tick` | integer | Units due to arrive next tick |
| `updated_at` | datetime | Timestamp of last write |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (critical)** - *The write semantics of this table are ambiguous. "Updated at the end of each tick" implies upsert (one live row per `(sim_id, item_id)`), but the presence of a `tick` column implies append (one row per `(sim_id, tick, item_id)`). These require different query patterns to read current state. Suggest stating explicitly: this table is **append-only**, with one row per `(sim_id, tick, item_id)`. Current state is always the row with the maximum `tick`. If upsert semantics are preferred instead, the `tick` column becomes an audit field and a separate query convention must be documented.*

## `ops_pending_orders`

Reorders that have been placed but not yet received.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `order_id` | string PK | Unique order identifier |
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run |
| `item_id` | string FK | Item type ordered |
| `supplier_id` | string FK | Supplier fulfilling the order |
| `order_tick` | integer | Tick at which the order was placed |
| `expected_arrival_tick` | integer | Tick at which goods are expected to arrive |
| `order_qty` | integer | Units ordered |
| `status` | enum | `pending`, `arrived`, `partially_lost`, `fully_lost` |
| `disruptions_active_at_order` | array[string] | Disruption IDs active when the order was placed |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *`fully_lost` has been added to the `status` enum here to handle the case where `transit_loss` magnitude = 1.0 destroys the entire shipment (see section 3.8 note). If a maximum magnitude cap below 1.0 is enforced instead, remove this value.*

## `ops_cost_accumulator`

Running cost totals per item type, updated each tick.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run |
| `tick` | integer | Current tick |
| `item_id` | string FK | Item type |
| `cumulative_holding_cost` | float | Total holding cost accrued so far |
| `cumulative_stockout_cost` | float | Total stockout penalty accrued so far |
| `cumulative_order_cost` | float | Total order cost (fixed + variable) accrued so far |
| `cumulative_transit_loss_cost` | float | Total transit loss cost accrued so far |
| `cumulative_total_cost` | float | Sum of all cost components |
| `remaining_budget` | float | Budget remaining for the run; null if unlimited |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (critical)** - *Same append-vs-upsert ambiguity as `ops_warehouse_state`. Suggest the same resolution: state the write semantics explicitly and document the query convention for reading current totals.*

## `ops_active_disruptions`

Disruptions currently in effect at the current tick.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run |
| `tick` | integer | Current tick |
| `disruption_id` | string FK | Disruption record |
| `item_id` | string FK | Affected item type |
| `disruption_type` | enum | Type of disruption |
| `effective_magnitude` | float | Actual magnitude applied this tick (may differ from scheduled if stochastic) |
| `is_active_this_tick` | boolean | Whether stochastic disruption triggered this tick |

# 6. Historical Data Tables

- These are append-only summaries used for agent context and observability
- They accumulate across ticks

## `hist_demand_actuals`

Realised demand drawn each tick, before stockout clipping.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run |
| `tick` | integer | Tick |
| `item_id` | string FK | Item type |
| `consumer_id` | string FK | Consumer that generated the demand |
| `raw_demand` | float | Demand sampled from pattern before disruption |
| `disrupted_demand` | float | Demand after disruption multipliers applied |
| `fulfilled_demand` | integer | Units actually issued from stock |
| `unmet_demand` | integer | Units of demand not fulfilled (stockout volume) |
| `pattern_id` | string FK | Pattern used to generate this demand |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (minor)** - *`raw_demand` is typed as float (the raw sample) while `fulfilled_demand` and `unmet_demand` are integer. The rounding/floor step that converts the float sample to an integer is not documented here or in section 3.5. Suggest adding a note: `disrupted_demand` is the float value after multipliers; `fulfilled_demand = min(floor(disrupted_demand), stock_on_hand)`; `unmet_demand = floor(disrupted_demand) - fulfilled_demand`.*

## `hist_supply_arrivals`

Record of every order arrival.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run |
| `tick` | integer | Tick of arrival |
| `order_id` | string FK | Order that arrived |
| `item_id` | string FK | Item type |
| `supplier_id` | string FK | Supplier |
| `ordered_qty` | integer | Original order quantity |
| `arrived_qty` | integer | Units that actually arrived (after transit loss) |
| `lost_qty` | integer | Units lost in transit (0 if no disruption) |
| `actual_lead_time_ticks` | integer | Ticks between order placement and this arrival |

## `hist_reorder_decisions`

Every reorder decision made by the agent, including decisions not to reorder.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run |
| `tick` | integer | Tick of decision |
| `item_id` | string FK | Item type evaluated |
| `stock_on_hand_at_decision` | integer | Stock level seen by agent |
| `stock_in_transit_at_decision` | integer | In-transit units seen by agent |
| `decision` | enum | `reorder` or `hold` |
| `order_qty` | integer | Units ordered; 0 if hold |
| `order_id` | string FK | Created order ID; null if hold |
| `agent_reasoning` | string | Free-text or structured reasoning from agent (for LLM agents) |
| `agent_version` | string | Version/identifier of the agent policy used |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (minor)** - *This table records decisions per item but not per supplier. If the 1-supplier-per-item constraint is ever relaxed, decisions become ambiguous. Suggest adding `supplier_id` (string FK, nullable) as a forward-compatibility column.*

## `hist_cost_by_tick`

Snapshot of cost components accrued in each individual tick (not cumulative).

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run |
| `tick` | integer | Tick |

| `transit_loss_cost` | float | Transit loss cost this tick |
| `total_cost` | float | Sum of above |

# 7. Event Logs

The event log is an append-only, immutable record of every state-changing event in the simulation. It is the source of truth for replay and audit.

## `event_log`

Single unified event stream; all event types write here.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `event_id` | string PK | Unique event identifier (UUID) |
| `sim_id` | string FK | Simulation run |
| `tick` | integer | Tick at which the event occurred |
| `event_type` | enum | See event types below |
| `item_id` | string FK | Item type involved; null for sim-level events |
| `entity_id` | string | ID of the primary entity (supplier, consumer, order, disruption); null if not applicable |
| `payload` | json | Event-specific data (quantities, costs, magnitudes, reasoning) |
| `logged_at` | datetime | Wall-clock time the event was written |

**Event types**:

| Event Type | Fired When | Key Payload Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `SIM_STARTED` | Tick 0 initialisation | `config_snapshot` |
| `SIM_ENDED` | Final tick completes | `total_cost`, `total_stockout_ticks`, `total_reorders` |
| `TICK_STARTED` | Beginning of each tick, before any sub-steps | `tick` |
| `TICK_ENDED` | End of each tick, after all sub-steps | `tick` |
| `DEMAND_DRAWN` | Demand sampled each tick per item | `raw_demand`, `disrupted_demand`, `fulfilled`, `unmet` |
| `SUPPLY_ARRIVED` | Pending order arrives | `order_id`, `ordered_qty`, `arrived_qty`, `lost_qty` |
| `REORDER_PLACED` | Agent places a reorder | `order_id`, `order_qty`, `expected_arrival_tick`, `order_cost` |
| `REORDER_HELD` | Agent evaluates and decides not to reorder | `stock_on_hand`, `stock_in_transit`, `reasoning` |
| `DISRUPTION_ACTIVATED` | Disruption begins or stochastic disruption triggers | `disruption_id`, `disruption_type`, `effective_magnitude` |
| `DISRUPTION_DEACTIVATED` | Disruption window ends | `disruption_id` |
| `STOCKOUT_OCCURRED` | Unmet demand > 0 in a tick | `unmet_demand`, `stockout_cost` |
| `BUDGET_WARNING` | Remaining budget falls below `budget_warning_threshold` | `remaining_budget`, `budget_limit`, `threshold` |
| `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` | Budget reaches zero | `tick`, `remaining_budget` |
| `COST_ACCRUED` | End-of-tick cost accumulation | `holding_cost`, `stockout_cost`, `order_cost`, `transit_loss_cost`, `tick_total` |
| `TRANSIT_LOSS_APPLIED` | Units lost from an in-transit order | `order_id`, `lost_qty`, `arrived_qty`, `disruption_id` |
| `LEAD_TIME_EXTENDED` | Transit delay disruption increases lead time of a placed order | `order_id`, `original_lead_time`, `extended_lead_time`, `disruption_id` |

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (important)** - *`TICK_STARTED` and `TICK_ENDED` events have been added to the table above. These bookend every tick in the log, making it possible to distinguish quiet ticks (no demand, no arrivals, no orders) from gaps or missing log entries during replay.*

> **⚠️ SUGGESTION (minor)** - *`BUDGET_WARNING` previously hardcoded the 10% threshold in its description. It now references the configurable `budget_warning_threshold` parameter (see section 3.1) and includes `threshold` as a payload field for auditability. Additionally, consider adding a one-shot guard: once `BUDGET_WARNING` has been fired for a given `sim_id`, it should not fire again until the budget recovers above the threshold. Otherwise it will fire on every tick once triggered, flooding the log.*
